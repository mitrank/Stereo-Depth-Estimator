Make sure you have "cmake" and "make" installed on you system.
The 'External' path in CMakeLists.txt contains the 'matplotlibcpp' and 'armadillo' header files which were installed on the system via terminal, but now are not used in the program. Hence, do not install it as it is not necessary.
'yolov4.weights' file should be in the 'build' folder but currently it is not due to it's larger size.
